# DNSSEC Oracle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ensdomains/dnssec-oracle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ensdomains/dnssec-oracle) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD--2--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This is an implementation of a DNSSEC oracle for Ethereum. With it, you can securely prove the contents of any DNSSEC-signed DNS record on the Ethereum blockchain, as long as it was signed using supported public key schemes and digests. Presently, the oracle only supports RSA and SHA-256; fortunately, over 3/4 of TLDs use this combination of algorithms.

Once a record is proven to the oracle, any contract or external caller can fetch it with the `rrsets` constant function, allowing other contracts to read data from DNS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

The DNSSEC Oracle uses npm to manage dependencies, therefore the installation process is kept simple:

```
npm install
```

### Running tests

The DNSSEC Oracle uses truffle for its ethereum development environment. All tests can be run using truffle:

```
truffle test
```

To run linting, use solium:

```
solium --dir ./contracts
```


### Usage

A [command line utility](https://github.com/arachnid/dnsprove) is available that automates the task of generating the necessary proofs from DNS data and submitting them to the oracle.

The oracle is still in alpha, and does not yet have any official deployments on the main network or test networks.
